How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

->  diff showed the change in files making it easier to spot the bugs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

->  if the program stops work one day ,you can go back to find bugs

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

->    you can make a changes but save it after a bug is introduced.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    ->git is a version control for a project of files.Google docs is a single document

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    ->How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files? * git log can be used to list the summaries of all the changes made to the repository. * git diff can be used to see what has actually changed between two given commits.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    you can undo changes

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    testing ground for webpages
